## About

I am an undergraduate at Tufts University majoring in Data Science. Beginning with an interest in statistics, I have gradually developed a passion for data analysis and machine learning since my junior year in high school and I have been constantly searching opportunities to advance my data science skills. This is a documentation of my learning experience, including a wide range of projects that I did on my own as well as learned from experts.

Entering the field of data science with only the knowledge of statistics was an interesting transition for me. My first ever contact with data science was a book called "Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques" that I binged reading for months in my junior year. The content encapsulated my interest from the very beginning. Even when it gets more "mathy" and abstract, I still felt motivated to get to understand all the chapters that I came across. This led me to explore linear algebra and calculus maths conceptually through Youtubers and towardsdatascience. There were concepts that I spent weeks to grasp, but the thrill I got in the end gave me the incentive to study more. Learning data science, at some point, has turned into one of my hobbies, the one which I would come for whenever I need to take my mind off the current workload...
